## Publications/Thesis
### Data Mining Approaches and Racial (Algorithmic) Bias in Healthcare for Hypertension And Hyperlipidemia

- This study employs machine learning models (including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost etc.) for the correlations and predictive modeling of hypertension and hyperlipidemia using the NHANES dataset. The analysis reveals noteworthy associations with various conditions such as prescription medication use, hyperlipidemia, difficulty stooping, diabetes, and arthritis. The models were implemented using Python (Scikit-learn), emphasizing the study's reliance on advanced computational techniques to gain insights into these health conditions.

### Ethics of Digital Health from an Islamic Perspective
[Publication](https://journals.ust.edu/index.php/JST/article/view/1993/1742)

- Promotes digital health to hold a great potential in improving healthcare, but ethical concerns, including privacy breaches and the risk of biases, emphasize the need for responsible technology use. An Islamic ethical framework is required to guide the development and application of digital health technologies to ensure moral righteousness and community well-being.
